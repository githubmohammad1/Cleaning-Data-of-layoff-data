#This project aims to analyze and visualize global layoffs in the private sector for the years 2020-2023. The data is sourced from the layoffs_dataset and has been processed using SQL to #create a database for easy management and analysis. The main focus of this project is to explore the trends in layoff during the covid-19 pandemic and the years following that. This #project showcases my skills in Tableau and SQL as I go through data cleaning, analysing and visualizing the layoffs dataset.
